                <h1>Why</h1>
                    <p>Our goal is to help facilitate matching future pet owners with the pet the best fits their life style. As lockdowns eased in the US, There
                        was a big <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/california-dogs-fill-shelters-pandemic-lockdowns-ease-2021-07-08/">increase in animals being 
                        abandoned at shelters</a>. People picked up pets while they were stuck at home, but now that many of them are back to their busy lifestyle, they
                        don't have time to care for their pets. It's sad what has happened to these pets, and we need to find them a new loving home!

                <h1>Why own a pet?</h1>
                <p>Pets are wonderful and playful companions that have been proven to enhance a person's mood and reduce depression. </p>

                            In the present study, this hypothesis was supported, because only those in the dog condition showed a significant 
                            increase in positive affect over time. Those participants who simply observed dogs in a video did not show an improvement 
                            in positive affect.

                            The results supported significant relationships between loneliness, pet attachment support, human social support, and depressed mood. No relationship 
                            was found between human social support and depressed mood. Pet attachment support, but not human social support, influenced the relationship between 
                            loneliness and depressed mood indicating the importance of pet attachment as a greater form of support in this sample.

                        <blockquote>
                            There is increasing evidence suggesting that pet ownership causes measurable short term psychological and physiological effects in people, including 
                            reduction of blood pressure and mitigation of psychological indicators of anxiety. There is also evidence that pet ownership is associated with clinically 
                            significant health effects in people, including improved survival after a coronary event. We hypothesize that pet ownership, through its ability to positively 
                            influence psychosocial risk factors, results in a lowered risk of coronary heart disease and increased survival after a coronary event if it occurs, and that 
                            increased pet ownership would further reduce mortality from coronary heart disease.
